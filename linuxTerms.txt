'sudo' - admin group
Directory - folder
/ - the root of the filesystem (this is the C: drive for linux)
* - means anything (You can use it alongside commands like 'sudo find / -iname '*.mp3', this command will list everything that has '.mp3' at the end of their name no matter what it says before that)
